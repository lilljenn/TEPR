# TEPR
Thought/Emotion Processing and Relaxation App

This app is designed to help identify thoughts and emotions and provide relaxation techniques. This app does not take the place of a psychology professional. Rather, TEPR is designed to aide people in identifying thought and emotion patterns to promote healthy discussions and treatment options with a professional. This app is not designed to be used in emergency situations, but if a psycholgy professional cannot be reached, it may be used to offer relaxation techniques. This may be helpful in highly stressful situations, but it does not take the place of calling for help if there is an emergency situation. If there is an emergency, please call 911.
